New podcast episode explores the shifting geography of energy demand News 18 December 2025

The latest episode of the IEA’s [Everything Energy](https://www.iea.org/podcasts/everything-energy) podcast looks at how the geography of global energy demand is changing – an important trend with major implications for policymakers and the energy sector as a whole.

For decades, energy consumption was largely concentrated in advanced economies such as the United States, Europe and Japan – until China’s rapid economic growth transformed the picture in the 2000s. Now, the momentum is shifting again, with a group of emerging economies poised to increasingly define energy market dynamics in the years ahead.

Now available on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/everything-energy/id1512991587) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0vO151tF787AJKATkt4LCJ), the episode features insights from Ali Saffar, Head of the IEA’s Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America Division, and IEA Energy Analyst Siddharth Singh. They discuss how energy demand has developed over the past half-century and explore how it could evolve in the future – highlighting new analysis in reports such as the [World Energy Outlook 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2025/) and [The Future of Electricity in the Middle East and North Africa](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-electricity-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa).

The IEA’s Everything Energy podcast offers fresh perspectives on a wide range of global energy issues through conversations with IEA experts.
