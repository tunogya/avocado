# Germans’ doubts about energy transition policies rise as climate fears recede – survey

Worries about the economy and security have partly superseded concerns about climate change among Germans, while scepticism about current implementation of the country’s landmark energy transition has grown, according to a [survey](https://www.bmw-foundation.org/press/press-releases/energy-transition-future-monitor-2026-allensbach-study) commissioned by the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt. The share of citizens who said they are “very concerned” about climate change currently stands at 33 percent, down from around 50 percent between 2019 and 2022.

“The results show a population increasingly torn between the long-term necessity of climate action and short-term fears about financial burdens and economic stability,” the foundation said.

A relative majority of the population still believes the energy transition is the right choice, but support has declined considerably. Some 43 percent said the nuclear phase-out and the expansion of renewable energies are the right policy path, down from 73 percent in 2012.

The German public is convinced that there is no alternative to the energy transition, the foundation said. But it added that “even among supporters of the energy transition, doubts are growing about whether policymakers are choosing the right measures and the right pace.” Within a single year, the share of energy transition supporters who believe that Germany is taking the right measures fell from 52 to 33 percent, while the group expressing doubts grew from 14 to 26 percent.

“For the first time, a relative majority of Germans associates the energy transition primarily with risks rather than opportunities. Concerns focus especially on rising energy prices, changes to the landscape, and uncertainty about energy supply security.”

Around 37 percent of respondents said they believe Germany is on the wrong track, with criticism particularly widespread in eastern Germany and among supporters of the populist far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).

More than three-quarters of respondents expect the energy transition to place heavy financial burdens on both households and the economy, the survey revealed. “Many fear negative effects on Germany’s competitiveness, traditional industries, and jobs, while only a minority expects significant economic benefits or falling electricity prices,” the foundation said.

Despite the rise in scepticism about implementation, public backing for state involvement in the energy transition remains strong. “A clear majority believes that the government should financially support the expansion of renewable energy and citizen-led energy projects. Photovoltaic systems, in particular, are widely seen as making an important contribution to energy security.”

[Many other surveys have also shown](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/polls-reveal-citizens-support-energiewende) that climate action has slipped in the German public's policy priorities, as issues such as a worsening economic outlook, geopolitical challenges in Ukraine and beyond, or the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic have taken precedence.
