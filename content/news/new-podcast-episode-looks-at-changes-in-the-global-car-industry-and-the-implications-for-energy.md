New podcast episode looks at changes in the global car industry and the implications for energy News 09 January 2026

The latest episode of the IEA’s [Everything Energy](https://www.iea.org/podcasts/everything-energy) podcast looks at the changes taking place in the global car industry, which is a key part of many economies with important implications for the energy sector.

The global car industry has operated under relatively stable conditions for decades. Now, that’s shifting as the geography of production evolves, new regions drive sales growth, and electric cars transform consumer choices.

Now available on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/everything-energy/id1512991587) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0vO151tF787AJKATkt4LCJ), the episode features insights from IEA Energy Technology Analysts Elizabeth Connelly and Leonardo Paoli – the lead authors of a [recent report](https://www.iea.org/reports/what-next-for-the-global-car-industry) on this subject. They unpack the structural trends – examining the underlying drivers, assessing the potential implications for the energy sector and beyond, and discussing how competitiveness can be sustained in this market context, while noting there is no one-size-fits-all approach.

The IEA’s Everything Energy podcast offers fresh perspectives on a wide range of global energy issues through conversations with IEA experts.
