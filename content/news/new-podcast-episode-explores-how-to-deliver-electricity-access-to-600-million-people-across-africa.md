New podcast episode explores how to deliver electricity access to 600 million people across Africa News 11 December 2025

The latest episode of the IEA’s [Everything Energy](https://www.iea.org/podcasts/everything-energy) podcast examines the strategies and investments needed to expand electricity access to the 600 million people in Africa who still live without it.

Now available on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/everything-energy/id1512991587) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0vO151tF787AJKATkt4LCJ), the episode features insights from Emma Gordon and Adam Ward, energy investment analysts and lead authors of a [recent IEA report](https://www.iea.org/reports/financing-electricity-access-in-africa) on this topic. They discuss new modelling that shows how to deliver universal electricity access across Africa in the next 10 years, along with the financial tools to make this milestone a reality.

The IEA’s Everything Energy podcast offers fresh perspectives on a wide range of global energy issues through conversations with IEA experts.
