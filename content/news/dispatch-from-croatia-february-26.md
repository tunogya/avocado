# Dispatch from Croatia | February '26

[Climate & CO2](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/topic/climate-co2)

[Policy](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/topic/policy)

Croatia finished public consultations on its Nuclear Energy Act in January. Following an analysis of submitted comments, the government is expected to forward the bill to the Croatian Parliament for the next legislative period. Meanwhile, Croatia’s Economy Minister, Ante Šušnjar, announced that Serbia is interested in accessing Croatia’s gas infrastructure via the expanded Krk LNG terminal, although Serbian authorities have not yet confirmed the plan. In addition, the Croatian government announced the gradual phase-out of state subsidies for solar and wind power.

## Stories to watch in the weeks ahead

- **Nuclear Act consultation ends, bill awaits parliament*****-*** Croatia has closed the [public consultation on the Act on the Application of Nuclear Energy for Civil Purposes](https://esavjetovanja.gov.hr/ECon/MainScreen?entityId=32309), a key piece of legislation aimed at establishing the legal and institutional framework for the potential future development of nuclear energy. Following an analysis of submitted comments in the public consultation, which ended on 17 January, the government is expected to forward the bill to the Croatian Parliament in the coming legislative period. Economy minister Ante Šušnjar said the law does not yet represent a decision to build a nuclear power plant, but rather [the creation of a framework](https://novac.jutarnji.hr/novac/aktualno/susnjar-reforme-energetike-hep-baterije-reverzibilne-elektrane-geotermalna-lng-krk-15665823) that would allow experts to make evidence-based decisions in the future. He noted that Croatia is [clearly defining nuclear energy as a desirable option](https://www.tehnoeko.com.hr/energetika/ministar-susnjar-jasno-kazemo-da-je-nuklearna-energija-pozeljna-u-hrvatskoj/a/11326) in the decarbonisation process alongside renewable energy sources, not as a replacement. [The Act on the construction of a Radioactive Waste Management Centre](https://www.sabor.hr/en/press/news/law-construction-radioactive-waste-management-centre-adopted) has already been adopted. Further plans include amendments to the Act on Radiological and Nuclear Safety and the establishment of an independent nuclear regulatory authority. According to Šušnjar, it is realistic to expect [that](https://ceenergynews.com/renewables/croatia-nuclear-renewables/) Croatia could make a [strategic decision](https://ceenergynews.com/renewables/croatia-nuclear-renewables/) on the direction of nuclear energy development within the next 18 months, whether through small modular reactors or other models.

## The latest from Croatia - last month in recap

- **LNG boost, regional connections in focus -**The [capacity of the LNG terminal on Croatia’s Krk Island](https://www.jutarnji.hr/novac/aktualno/susnjar-reforme-energetike-hep-baterije-reverzibilne-elektrane-geotermalna-lng-krk-15665823) has increased to 6.1 billion cubic meters per year, strengthening gas supply security for Croatia and the wider region, economy minister Šušnjar said. At the same time, [Croatia is investing in the expansion of its gas pipeline](https://vlada.gov.hr/susnjar-nacionalnim-planom-oporavka-i-otpornosti-osigurano-vise-od-pola-milijarde-eura-za-elektroenergetski-sustav/43743) network toward Slovenia, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia. Šušnjar said the goal is to enable Southeastern Europe to use the terminal’s full capacity via Croatia as early as this year. He confirmed that [Serbia has expressed interest](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/susnjar-serbia-interested-in-receiving-natural-gas-via-croatia-dedovic-handanovic-just-considering-it-for-now/) in accessing the Krk terminal through a planned gas interconnection, while Serbia’s energy minister said the option is being considered cautiously due to past supply disruptions.

- **Renewable incentives under criticism -** Economy minister Šušnjar said Croatia’s energy transition began around 15 years ago, but that some decisions made at the time were wrong, and the consequences are still being felt today. Speaking at Jutarnji list’s energy conference [*Croatia Facing the Decisions of the Decade*](https://www.jutarnji.hr/novac/aktualno/energetika-2026-hrvatska-odluke-sigurnost-opsrbe-hep-solar-se-korlat-nuklearna-15665763), he criticised the fact that renewable energy incentive schemes were introduced too quickly and without sufficient analysis, while neglecting the grid and consumers. He recalled that [more than four billion euros have so far been spent on renewable energy incentives](https://www.jutarnji.hr/novac/aktualno/susnjar-reforme-energetike-hep-baterije-reverzibilne-elektrane-geotermalna-lng-krk-15665823), while the gross value added of the energy sector has declined by around 25 percent over the past ten years.

- **Incentives to be phased out -** The public tender for electricity production from renewable energy sources, [conducted by the Croatian Energy Market Operator](https://www.hrote.hr/javni-pozivi-i-natjecaji-za-poticanje-oie) at the end of 2024, [could have been the last for solar and wind power plants](https://www.jutarnji.hr/novac/aktualno/susnjar-reforme-energetike-hep-baterije-reverzibilne-elektrane-geotermalna-lng-krk-15665823). Economy minister Šušnjar announced that the state will no longer subsidise electricity generation from these sources. Šušnjar said that the [renewable energy surcharge included in electricity prices will not increase](https://www.jutarnji.hr/novac/aktualno/susnjar-reforme-energetike-hep-baterije-reverzibilne-elektrane-geotermalna-lng-krk-15665823), while the existing incentive budget will in future be redirected toward other types of investments, such as battery storage systems. [The Renewable Energy Sources of Croatia Association assessed](https://oie.hr/najava-ministra-o-ukidanju-poticaja-za-sunce-i-vjetar-nije-iznenadila-investitore/) that this does not represent a shift away from renewables, but rather a confirmation of their market maturity and competitiveness without guaranteed feed-in tariffs.

- **Government launches bioeconomy strategy -** Croatia's government has adopted [a draft Bioeconomy Strategy 2035](https://poljoprivreda.gov.hr/vijesti/vlada-usvojila-strategiju-biogospodarstva-do-2035/8082), which is accompanying by 200 million euros in investments. [The strategy includes measures](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/croatia-prepares-first-bioeconomy-strategy/) such as building biomass distribution centres, regulating the use of waste sludge, supporting the construction and modernisation of facilities in bioeconomy sectors, and promoting packaging made from recycled materials as well as bio-based and biodegradable plastics.

- **Investment in 206 electric buses*****-***Seventeen Croatian cities and municipalities have [received 143 million euros to procure 206 electric buses](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/croatian-cities-are-purchasing-206-electric-buses/), with total investment estimated at 163 million euros. The Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure has signed seven contracts for subsidising these purchases.

- **Croatia among top EU countries in renewable power -********[Croatia ranks third](https://forbes.dnevnik.hr/aktualno/hrvatska-u-vrhu-eu-po-potrosnji-struji-iz-obnovljivih-izvora-energije/) in the European Union by the share of electricity generated from renewable sources and sixth by the share of renewable electricity in total consumption, according to data from Eurostat. Across the European Union, [renewable energy sources accounted for 47.5 percent](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20260114-1) of gross electricity consumption last year. This represents an increase of 2.1 percentage points compared with 2023 and nearly a threefold rise since 2004, when renewables made up just 15.9 percent of electricity consumption.

## Katarina’s picks – reading recommendations & events

- **Registration open for Solar Flex Croatia 2026 -** Registration has opened for [Solar Flex Croatia 2026](https://oie.hr/otvorene-prijave-za-solar-flex-croatia-2026/), a European conference focused on power system flexibility, energy storage and the integration of renewable energy sources, to be held on 17 March 2026 in Zagreb. The conference for the second consecutive year is held as part of the [Let’s Flex](https://www.solarpowereurope.org/advocacy/lets-flex) European campaign, organised by Renewable Energy Sources of Croatia and SolarPower Europe. The programme will also feature the presentation of [Croatia’s first national study on battery energy storage needs](https://oie.hr/nova-studija-oieh-a-o-primjeni-baterija-u-elektroenergetskoj-mrezi/), prepared by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing and the Hrvoje Požar Energy Institute with support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
