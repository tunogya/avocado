New podcast episode examines the surge in energy jobs News 05 February 2026

The latest episode of the IEA’s [Everything Energy](https://www.iea.org/podcasts/everything-energy) podcast surveys the global landscape for energy jobs, looking at the biggest engines for growth across the sector and the challenges that could undermine future momentum.

Now available on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/everything-energy/id1512991587) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0vO151tF787AJKATkt4LCJ), the episode features insights from Elspeth Hathaway and Rebecca Ruff, two authors of the [World Energy Employment 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-employment-2025) report. They discuss the demographics of the energy sector, what has been driving the strong increase in global energy employment, and how to tackle growing skills shortages, which could complicate efforts by countries to meet rising energy demand securely and affordably.

The Everything Energy podcast offers fresh perspectives on a wide range of global energy issues through conversations with IEA experts.
