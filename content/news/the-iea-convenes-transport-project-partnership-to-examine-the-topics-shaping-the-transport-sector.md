The IEA convenes Transport Project Partnership to examine the topics shaping the transport sector News 09 December 2025

#### Held at the IEA headquarters in Paris, the annual meeting brought together around 40 transport experts and stakeholders to discuss issues shaping the sector

Discussions focused on the latest trends in the car and heavy-duty vehicle markets, particularly priorities for maintaining competitiveness across different world regions, a key concern highlighted in the IEA’s recent [What next for the global car industry?](https://www.iea.org/reports/what-next-for-the-global-car-industry) report.

A dedicated session examined the role of sustainable fuels for transport, in light of relevant policy developments over recent months. A Transport Project Partner facilitated a learning module exploring the linkages between electric heavy-duty vehicle charging and grid expansion, and representatives from service providers, non-governmental organisations and research centres also provided updates on approaches to different charging business models.

At the event, partners were joined by a range of stakeholders working on energy and transport, including from governments, IEA Technology Collaboration Programmes and the automotive industry more widely. Members of the Partnership also took part in a closed-door meeting during which IEA transport analysts presented key updates from the IEA’s recent modelling work and projection results set to be published in the coming months.

The [IEA Transport Project Partnership](https://www.iea.org/programmes/transport-project-partnership) was established to support dialogue on matters relevant for transport, energy, demand and activity projection methodologies for various transport modes, and the environment and climate change. Members of the Partnership include senior experts from a varied mix of 25 organisations from different geographies across a wide range of sectors, including energy companies, automotive original equipment manufacturers, automotive suppliers, chemical companies, government organisations, aircraft manufacturers, research organisations and data providers. Meetings of the Partnership support the exchange of ideas and information, allowing the IEA to strengthen the knowledge base for its analysis and research.
